While MySQL, SQL, and PostgreSQL share a common foundation in the SQL language, there are some subtle syntax differences between them. These differences stem from each database's unique features and implementation choices. Here are some examples of syntax variations across these databases:

**Data Types:**

- MySQL supports data types like `BOOLEAN`, `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, and `TIME`.

- PostgreSQL offers a wider range of data types, including `ARRAY`, `HSTORE`, `JSONB`, and `UUID`.

**Table Creation:**

- MySQL uses the `CREATE TABLE` statement to define tables, specifying column names, data types, and constraints.

- PostgreSQL's `CREATE TABLE` syntax allows for more granular control over table properties, such as table partitions, inheritance, and CHECK constraints.

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):**

- MySQL and PostgreSQL share common DML statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- PostgreSQL introduces unique features like `UPSERT` (INSERT or UPDATE) and `MERGE` (combine INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE).

**Subqueries:**

- MySQL supports basic subqueries within `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses.

- PostgreSQL offers more advanced subquery capabilities, including correlated subqueries, recursive subqueries, and `WITH` clauses.

**Window Functions:**

- MySQL provides a limited set of window functions for data aggregation and transformation.

- PostgreSQL offers a richer assortment of window functions, including `RANK()`, `PERCENTILE_CONT()`, and `LEAD()`.

**User-Defined Types (UDTs):**

- MySQL allows for defining custom scalar data types using `CREATE FUNCTION` and `CREATE PROCEDURE` statements.

- PostgreSQL supports user-defined composite types (similar to structs) and more complex functions with `CREATE FUNCTION` and `RETURNS TABLE`.

These examples illustrate the variations in syntax between MySQL, SQL, and PostgreSQL. While the core SQL language remains consistent, each database has introduced its own extensions and refinements. As a developer, it's important to be familiar with the syntax specific to the database you're working with.
